## Introduction
The Cafe Management System is a C++ project designed to streamline cafe operations for owners and customers. It enables efficient inventory management, secure data access, and seamless order processing.  
Key Features:
- A password-protected owner mode for menu and inventory management.
- A customer interface for browsing menus, placing orders, and calculating total costs.  
This project emphasizes software reliability, error handling, and real-world applicability, making it both educational and practical.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 2.1 Planning
#### 2.1.1 Project Objectives
The project was planned to:
- Provide a dual-mode system for owners and customers.
- Ensure robust input validation and error handling.
- Maintain scalability and modularity.

#### 2.1.2 Menu Management Features
- Owners can view, add, update, and delete menu items.
- Customers can order items and calculate total costs dynamically.

---

### 2.2 Requirements Analysis
#### 2.2.1 Owner Features
- Add, delete, update menu items.
- Change the password for secure access.

#### 2.2.2 Customer Features
- Place orders and calculate the total cost.

#### 2.2.3 Challenges Identified
- Handling invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric data).
- Preventing duplicate menu items.
- Implementing a secure password-protected owner mode.

---

### 2.3 Design
#### 2.3.1 System Algorithm
1. **Initialize Variables**: Arrays for storing menu items, prices, and quantities.
2. **Display Welcome Message**: A greeting and main menu options.
3. **Owner Mode**:
   - Password-protected access.
   - Functions for menu management and password changes.
4. **Customer Mode**:
   - Order items from menus and calculate the total cost.
   - Update inventory dynamically.

---

### 2.4 Implementation
#### 2.4.1 Key Features Used
- **Arrays**: To store menu items, prices, and quantities.
- **Functions**: To modularize code for better readability and debugging.
- **Loops and Conditionals**: For program control and logic flow.

#### 2.4.2 Code Explanation by Blocks
1. **Program Setup**: Initialize arrays, variables, and constants.
2. **Menus**: Functions to display food and drink menus.
3. **Owner Mode**: Menu management and password security.
4. **Customer Mode**: Ordering and cost calculation.

---

### 2.5 Testing
#### 2.5.1 Testing Scenarios
- Valid and invalid inputs for both modes.
- Edge cases like maximum items and empty menus.

#### 2.5.2 Resolved Issues
- **Infinite Loops**: Caused by invalid inputs; resolved using input validation.
- **Duplicate Items**: Prevented by checking for existing items.

---

### 2.6 Deployment
#### 2.6.1 Local Setup
- Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
- Ensure runtime libraries are installed.

#### 2.6.2 Post-Deployment Considerations
- Provide user documentation for setup and usage.
- Address user feedback for improvements.

---

### 2.7 Maintenance
#### 2.7.1 Future Enhancements
- Integration with a database for persistent storage.
- Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Advanced search and filtering options.

---

## Conclusion
The Cafe Management System is a well-structured project that meets its operational goals. It offers a secure, efficient platform for cafe operations while demonstrating key programming principles.  
The project's emphasis on reliability, scalability, and user experience makes it a valuable tool for small businesses and an excellent learning resource for developers.
